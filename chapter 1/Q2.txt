 a and b are assigned the values 2 and 1, respectively. In the first step, --a is a pre-decrement operation, meaning the value of a is reduced by 1 before being used, so a becomes 1. Next, in the expression --a - --b, both a and b are pre-decremented, making a equal to 0 and b equal to 0. The result of the subtraction is 0 - 0, which equals 0. Then, in the expression --a - --b + ++b, b is pre-incremented to 1 before being used, so the result becomes 0 + 1, which equals 1. Finally, in the expression --a - --b + ++b + b--, b-- is a post-decrement operation, meaning b is used first (as 1) and then decremented to 0. The result of this final expression is 1 + 1, which equals 2. Thus, after all the operations, the values are a = 0, b = 0, and result = 2.
